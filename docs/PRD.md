# User Management Android App - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### Project Vision
To create a simple yet powerful Android application that enables efficient user management through CRUD operations, built with modern Android development tools and following best practices in software architecture.

### Goals
- Implement a clean, intuitive user interface using Jetpack Compose
- Provide robust local data persistence using Room database
- Demonstrate SOLID principles and MVVM architecture
- Showcase the Observer pattern through StateFlow implementation
- Serve as a learning resource for modern Android development

### Overview
The User Management App is an Android application built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Room database. It provides essential CRUD operations for managing user records while maintaining data persistence and real-time UI updates through the Observer pattern.

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary Persona
**Name**: System Administrator  
**Background**: Manages user accounts and permissions  
**Goals**:  
- Create and manage user profiles efficiently
- Update user information as needed
- Remove inactive users from the system
- View user details quickly

### Secondary Persona
**Name**: Android Developer (Student/Beginner)  
**Background**: Learning modern Android development practices  
**Goals**:  
- Understand Jetpack Compose implementation
- Learn Room database integration
- Study MVVM architecture and SOLID principles
- Implement Observer pattern with StateFlow

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Create User
- Input fields:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address
  - Phone Number
  - Address
  - Date of Birth
- Form validation
- Success dialog confirmation
- Real-time UI update after creation

### 3.2 View Users
- Scrollable list of users
- User card layout with summary information

### 3.3 Update User
- Edit user information
- Form pre-filled with existing data
- Validation of updated information
- Success confirmation
- Real-time UI updates

### 3.4 Delete User
- Delete user entry
- Confirmation dialog
- Remove from local database
- Update UI list immediately

## 4. User Stories/Flows

### System Administrator Stories
1. "As an admin, I want to create new user profiles so that I can add users to the system."
2. "As an admin, I want to view all users so that I can manage them effectively."
3. "As an admin, I want to update user information when details change."
4. "As an admin, I want to remove users who are no longer active."

### Developer Stories
1. "As a developer, I want to understand how to implement MVVM architecture in Android."
2. "As a developer, I want to learn how to use Room database for local storage."
3. "As a developer, I want to see how to implement the Observer pattern with StateFlow."

## 5. Business Rules

### Data Validation
- Email must be in valid format
- Phone number must follow standard format
- Name cannot be empty
- Date of birth must be valid
- All fields must have appropriate length limits

### Data Management
- Deleted users are permanently removed from Room database
- UI updates immediately reflect database changes
- Data persists between app sessions

## 6. Data Models/Entities

### User
- ID (Primary Key)
- Full Name
- Email
- Phone Number
- Address
- Date of Birth
- Created At
- Updated At

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- App launch time < 2 seconds
- CRUD operations < 1 second
- Smooth scrolling with user list
- Efficient Room database queries

### Scalability
- Support for up to 1000 user records
- Efficient memory management
- Optimized database operations

### Security
- Input sanitization
- Data validation
- Secure storage of user information

### Usability
- Material Design 3 interface
- Clear error messages
- Responsive touch interactions
- Intuitive navigation

### Accessibility
- Screen reader support
- Adequate touch targets
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Sufficient color contrast

## 8. Success Metrics

### User Experience
