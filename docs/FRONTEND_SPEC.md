# FRONTEND_SPEC.md

## Purpose
This document defines the frontend rules, UI/UX standards, and component specifications for the User Management Android App. It ensures consistency, usability, and maintainability across the application.

---

## 1. General UI/UX Principles
- Follow Material Design 3 guidelines for all UI components
- Ensure responsive layouts for various device sizes and orientations
- Prioritize accessibility (color contrast, touch targets, screen reader support)
- Provide clear feedback for user actions (loading, errors, success)
- Use consistent spacing, typography, and iconography throughout the app

---

## 2. Navigation
- Use a top app bar with a hamburger menu for the navigation drawer
- The navigation drawer must include:
  - App title
  - App version at the bottom
- All navigation actions must use the app's navigation controller
- Navigating to a new page should update the app bar title accordingly

---

## 3. Home Page (Landing Page)
- Title: Display "User Management" at the top
- Show a prominent "Add User" button (FloatingActionButton)
- Tapping "Add User" navigates to the "Create User" page
- Display user list in a scrollable format
- Each user card should show:
  - User's full name
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Quick actions (Edit/Delete)
- If the user list is empty, show a friendly empty state message

---

## 4. Create User Page
- Title: "Create User"
- Display a form with the following fields:
  - Full Name (required)
  - Email Address (required, valid email format)
  - Phone Number (required, valid phone format)
  - Address
  - Date of Birth (required)
- Validate all required fields and show error messages for invalid input
- Provide "Save" and "Cancel" actions
- On successful save, show success dialog and return to Home page

---

## 5. Edit User Page
- Title: "Edit User"
- Pre-fill all user information in the form
- Same validation rules as Create User page
- Provide "Update" and "Cancel" actions
- On successful update, show success dialog and return to Home page

---

## 6. Delete User
- Show confirmation dialog before deletion
- On confirmation, remove user and show success message
- Update the user list immediately after deletion

---

## 7. Accessibility & Internationalization
- All interactive elements must be accessible via screen readers
- Support for dynamic font sizes and high-contrast mode
- All text must be localizable (use string resources)

---

## 8. Error Handling & Feedback
- Show clear error messages for:
  - Invalid email format
  - Invalid phone number format
  - Required field validation
  - Database operation failures
- Use Snackbars for transient feedback
- Show loading indicators during database operations

---

## 9. Testing & Acceptance
- All UI components must be testable with UI tests
- Acceptance criteria for each feature:
  - Create User: Successfully adds new user to database
  - Edit User: Successfully updates existing user information
  - Delete User: Successfully removes user from database
  - View Users: Displays all users in a scrollable list
- No critical or major UI bugs should be present in release builds

---

## 10. Code Quality
- Use Jetpack Compose for all UI components
- Follow MVVM architecture
- Use ViewModels for state management
- Keep UI logic separate from business logic
- Use composable functions for reusable UI elements:
  - UserCard
  - UserForm
  - ConfirmationDialog
  - LoadingIndicator
  - ErrorMessage

---

## 11. Component Specifications

### UserCard
```kotlin
@Composable
fun UserCard(
    user: User,
    onEditClick: (User) -> Unit,
    onDeleteClick: (User) -> Unit
)
```
- Displays user information in a Material Card
- Shows edit and delete icons
- Handles click events for edit and delete actions

### UserForm
```kotlin
@Composable
fun UserForm(
    user: User?,
    onSave: (User) -> Unit,
    onCancel: () -> Unit
)
```
- Reusable form for both create and edit operations
- Handles all input validation
- Shows error messages for invalid inputs

### ConfirmationDialog
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ConfirmationDialog(
    title: String,
    message: String,
    onConfirm: () -> Unit,
    onDismiss: () -> Unit
)
```
- Used for delete confirmation
- Shows clear message about the action
- Provides confirm and cancel options

---

## 12. State Management
- Use StateFlow for UI state management
- States to track:
  - Loading state
  - Error state
  - Success state
  - User list state
- Handle state changes in ViewModel
- Update UI based on state changes

---

## 13. Future-Proofing
- Design components to be easily extendable
- Document all custom components and navigation flows
- Prepare for potential future features:
  - User profile images
  - User roles and permissions
  - Export/import functionality
  - Search functionality (future enhancement)
  - Offline sync (future enhancement)
